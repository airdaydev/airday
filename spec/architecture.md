# Architecture

## Crate layout

```
Cargo.toml         workspace root
crates/
  protocol/        shared wire types (serde + rmp-serde)
core/              rust lib — loro, e2ee, sync engine. native + wasm targets.
core/web/          wasm-bindgen surface (excluded from default-members)
server/            rust bin — http + ws, sqlite-backed, dumb relay
cli/               rust bin — depends on core, integration test surface
```

Single workspace. Always invoke wasm builds as `wasm-pack build core/` (never bare `cargo build --target wasm32-...` at root, which would try to build server/cli for wasm and choke).

**Split plan:** when `crates/protocol/` reaches a stable enough shape, extract `core/` + `crates/protocol/` into a separate FOSS repo; `server/` consumes via git submodule + path dep. Defer until then — the workspace's atomic cross-crate refactor benefits dominate during high-churn early development.

## Build targets

- `core` builds for: native (linux/mac/windows) and `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- WASM build via `wasm-pack`; web bindings live in `core/web/`.
- `server` and `cli` are native-only.

## Cross-platform client boundary

Airday's sync protocol state machine lives in shared Rust, not reimplemented per client. The shared `core::sync::SyncEngine` is **sans-IO**:

- it owns protocol state, doc application, encryption framing, and push/pull/ack sequencing
- it does **not** own the socket, timers, reconnect policy, auth transport, or debounce policy
- callers feed transport events in (`handle_connected`, inbound frame bytes, disconnects, timeouts) and drain outbound frame bytes / engine events out

This keeps Loro + crypto + protocol behavior identical across clients while letting each host platform own transport policy:

- CLI: native Rust + `tokio-tungstenite`
- Web: wasm-bindgen surface over the same engine, browser `WebSocket` owned by JS
- Future native clients: the same `core` crate exposed over UniFFI to Swift / Kotlin transport shells

Two boundary rules matter:

- **No push pipelining.** The engine serializes pushes. If local mutations happen while a push is in flight, the engine marks itself dirty and re-ships its outbox only after the server ack arrives. This avoids duplicate export windows and keeps host adapters simple.
- **Auth stays outside the engine.** The engine starts from "socket is authenticated and usable". Whether that came from a bearer header, cookie-backed browser session, or future ticket exchange is a client / transport concern documented in `auth.md`.

Platform policy stays outside `core`:

- reconnect/backoff
- online/offline and visibility hooks
- mutation flush debounce
- worker placement for expensive client-side KDF work

## Local persistence

Persistence is **inside** the engine's contract, via one Rust trait — `core::LocalStorage` (`core/src/storage.rs`). The engine appends an encrypted op row on each local commit (`capture_local_ops`) and each applied remote op, stamps `server_seq` on ack, drives the push from `storage.outbox()`, and rebuilds the doc from snapshot + replay on boot. Storage is mandatory: there is no storage-less engine mode.

Two implementations satisfy the same semantics on different substrates:

- **CLI / server-side single-account flows:** `SqliteStorage` (`cli/src/storage.rs`, `rusqlite`, file on disk; synchronously durable).
- **Web:** `IdbStorage` (`js/core/src/storage/idb-storage.ts`) behind a wasm-bindgen `EngineStorage` extern (`core/web/src/lib.rs`). The trait is synchronous; IDB is async, so `IdbStorage` keeps a synchronous in-memory mirror the engine reads/writes immediately and flushes IDB in the background, signalling real durability back via `notify_oplog_durable`. The engine stays on the main thread (no Worker).

The rationale and history — including why web uses IDB rather than sqlite-wasm — live in `spec/local-storage.md`.

## Server-is-dumb thesis

The server **cannot**:
- read op contents (opaque encrypted blobs)
- run a Loro doc
- validate op semantics
- compute snapshots

The server **can**:
- authenticate accounts and devices
- assign per-account monotonic, gap-free `seq`
- track per-device `last_acked_seq`
- compute horizon = min(`last_acked_seq`) across all non-revoked devices
- decide when a snapshot is due (op-count threshold past last snapshot, triggering device caught up)
- ask any caught-up connected client to produce the snapshot (state frontier = `server_last_seq`, compaction floor = `max(horizon, prev snapshot's compaction_floor_seq)`)
- replace prior snapshots and prune ops up to the snapshot's `compaction_floor_seq`

This thesis is load-bearing for everything in `sync-protocol.md`.

## Wire encoding

All HTTP bodies and all WebSocket frames are **MessagePack** (`rmp-serde`). Single encoding everywhere; same `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` types as everything else. Native byte support means no base64-wrap of encrypted blobs. MessagePack's tagged-map semantics give us free additive compat (add a field → old decoders ignore it; remove a field → use `Option`).

`Content-Type: application/msgpack` on HTTP. WS frames are binary.

A `cargo run -p airday -- decode <file>` debug subcommand pretty-prints any captured frame as JSON for inspection (and, given the DEK, can decrypt op blobs in the same pass).
