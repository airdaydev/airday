//! Sans-IO sync engine: the protocol state machine in shared Rust.
//!
//! The engine owns no socket, no clock, no thread. The caller (CLI's
//! tokio adapter, the browser's `WebSocket`, mobile's `URLSession` /
//! OkHttp) feeds it transport events via `handle_*` and drains
//! ready-to-send frame bytes via `pop_outbox()` and engine events via
//! `pop_event()`.
//!
//! Two independent responsibilities meet here
//! (`spec/vv-wal-separation.md`):
//!
//!   - **Local crash recovery** — every commit (local mutation or
//!     applied remote op) is captured into the encrypted WAL through
//!     the [`LocalStorage`] trait; when the WAL crosses the host's
//!     threshold the engine folds it into a fresh full-history
//!     snapshot and prunes the folded prefix. This runs regardless of
//!     online/sync status.
//!   - **Outbound sync** — what needs uploading is derived from Loro
//!     history against `server_known_vv` (the operations proven to
//!     exist in the server op stream), never from which WAL rows still
//!     exist. At most one push is in flight at a time, durably
//!     recorded with a `push_id` before its first send so a crash
//!     between server insert and client ack retries the exact same
//!     push and the server deduplicates.
//!
//! See `spec/architecture.md` for the client-boundary rationale. The
//! state diagram is reproduced below:
//!
//! ```text
//!                          flush w/ pending
//!   Disconnected           ┌───────────────┐
