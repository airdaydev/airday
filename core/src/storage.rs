//! Local-storage trait shared by every Airday client.
//!
//! Local persistence and outbound sync are **separate concerns**
//! (`spec/vv-wal-separation.md`):
//!
//!   - Crash recovery is snapshot + WAL: one encrypted full-history
//!     Loro snapshot per doc plus a bounded encrypted WAL of updates
//!     applied after it. Every commit — local mutation or applied
//!     remote op — is appended to the WAL; when the WAL crosses the
//!     host's threshold the engine folds it into a fresh snapshot and
//!     prunes the folded prefix. This happens regardless of
//!     online/sync status; a full Loro snapshot retains operation
//!     history, so unsent local operations survive folding and can be
//!     re-derived later.
//!   - What needs uploading is derived from Loro history against
//!     `server_known_vv` — the operations proven to exist in the
//!     server op stream — never from which WAL rows still exist.
//!   - `last_acked_server_seq` is the durable server-log delivery
//!     frontier (the resume `PullOps` cursor). Server seq stays the
//!     opaque delivery/resume/compaction coordinate; VVs never cross
//!     the wire in plaintext.
//!   - At most one durable in-flight push per doc records the exact
//!     encrypted blob (and its `push_id`) currently on the wire, so a
//!     crash between server insert and client ack retries the same
//!     `push_id` and the server deduplicates.
//!
//! Two implementations satisfy the trait:
//!
//!   - `SqliteStorage` (CLI, future native apps) — `rusqlite` against a
//!     file on disk. Writes are synchronously durable: the trait method
//!     returns only after the SQL transaction commits.
//!   - `IdbStorage` (web) — IndexedDB behind a wasm-bindgen `extern`
//!     interface. Writes update an in-memory mirror synchronously (so
//!     the trait method can return immediately) and the underlying IDB
//!     transaction flushes in the background. The engine learns about
//!     real durability via a separate callback so the server-side `Ack`
//!     frame isn't shipped until the bytes are actually on disk.
//!
//! Both impls live outside `core/`: native in
//! `crates/storage-sqlite`, web in `js/core/src/storage/idb-storage.ts`
//! plus `core/web/src/lib.rs`. `MemStorage` (this file) is the
//! in-memory test double used by `core` unit tests.
//!
//! See `spec/local-storage.md` for the schema and boot semantics.
