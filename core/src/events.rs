//! Domain-level change events emitted by `Doc` after every commit
//! (local mutation) or remote import. Local mutation methods push
//! exact events surgically; remote imports are translated from Loro's
//! per-container diffs by `Doc::translate_captured_diffs`. Bulk/opaque
//! frames emit one `FullResync` control event instead of N synthetic item
//! events.
//!
//! These are the contract between the core and every UI layer. A
//! consumer (Solid store, SwiftUI `@Observable`, Compose `StateFlow`)
//! mirrors each event into its native reactive primitive with a
//! surgical write — no diff or reconciliation needed at the UI layer.
//!
//! Initial attachment materializes current state explicitly. After that,
//! consumers receive live deltas or an occasional `FullResync` request.
